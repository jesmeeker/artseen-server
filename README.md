# ArtSeen: A Web App for Artists to connect with buyers, appreciators, and gallery manangers.

## Primary Features:
ArtSeen is a place for artists to showcase their work in the hopes to gain exposure in their communities, find buyers for their pieces, and to market to gallery owners/managers who want to show their work.


Artists can upload pieces to show on ArtSeen. They can provide many data points for each piece, for example: art type, sub types, medium, surface, size, weight, if it is available to purchase or show, if the artist is willing to ship, whether or not it's unique and, if not, how many are avaialble.

Art appreciators can create an account to view art and browse artists. They can like pieces, much like you would like a social media image or post, they can favorite specific pieces which they can later view their favorites. They can add pieces to a cart and purchase those pieces. And, they can follow specific artists.

Gallery managers/owners are unable to purchase pieces directly from the artists to protect private buyer's interest. However, they can sign-up for an account to discover new artists and pieces that are available to show. In future versions, gallery managers will be able to initiate contact with artists through the app. Artists will not be able to initiate contact with gallery manager, but once a gallery manager initiates contact their conversations will remain until the gallery manager terminates the contact.


## Target Audience:
Artists, art collectors, gallery owners/managers.
